 El Doctor - A monitoring tool to rule them all!

- Module: **Scripting** 
- Competence: `is able to write a custom script to monitor machines`


## The mission


You will have multiple days to make it as **useful** (_collect the data you want or need_) and **fancy** (_interactive interface_, _features_, _..._) as possible, the goal is for you to **be creative** and **make it your own**! As such, we won't give you clear instructions to follow nor specific features to implement:

- Make an interactive [curses interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)) (_or similar_) for your script.
- Deploy your script on a machine you manage and use something like [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to execute once an hour.
- Collect metrics every hour and store them in an [CSV file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).
- If the state of the machine is critical (_not enough ram_, _..._), notify yourself by mail.
- Send yourself a system report once a week.

In order to validate this challenge, you must have a repository containing your script and its documentation along with your script. 

> **NOTE**: As mentioned you should make the script as complex and fancy as you can, use this opportunity to practice both your understanding of monitoring and your scripting capabilities.

## Final Words

Even though the modern IT ecosystem is full of wonderfully designed tools it's always a good thing to know how it works under the hood and to be able to spin up your own solution when needed. Sometimes a bazooka, no matter how pretty it is, is a bit overkill to hit the target!
