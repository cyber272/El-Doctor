El Doctor - A monitoring tool to rule them all!

Module: Scripting
Competence: is able to write a custom script to monitor machines

The mission

You will have multiple days to make it as useful (collect the data you want or need) and fancy (interactive interface, features, ...) as possible, the goal is for you to be creative and make it your own! As such, we won't give you clear instructions to follow nor specific features to implement:

Make an interactive curses interface (or similar) for your script.
Deploy your script on a machine you manage and use something like cron to execute once an hour.
Collect metrics every hour and store them in an CSV file.
If the state of the machine is critical (not enough ram, ...), notify yourself by mail.
Send yourself a system report once a week.
In order to validate this challenge, you must have a repository containing your script and its documentation along with your script.

NOTE: As mentioned you should make the script as complex and fancy as you can, use this opportunity to practice both your understanding of monitoring and your scripting capabilities.

Final Words

Even though the modern IT ecosystem is full of wonderfully designed tools it's always a good thing to know how it works under the hood and to be able to spin up your own solution when needed. Sometimes a bazooka, no matter how pretty it is, is a bit overkill to hit the target!
