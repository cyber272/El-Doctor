### Plan:

#### 1. **Setup Environment and Dependencies:**
   - Ensure Python is installed on the system.
   - Install `psutil` library for system monitoring: `pip install psutil`.
   - Python's built-in `smtplib` will be used for sending email notifications.

#### 2. **Monitoring Script (`monitoring_tool.py`):**
   - Use `psutil` to gather system metrics:
     - CPU usage (`psutil.cpu_percent()`)
     - Memory usage (`psutil.virtual_memory().percent`)
     - Disk space usage (`psutil.disk_usage('/')`)
     - Network metrics (e.g., `psutil.net_io_counters()` for network I/O)

   - Implement data collection and storage:
     - Write collected metrics to a CSV file at regular intervals (e.g., every hour using cron job).

#### 3. **Alerting and Notification:**
   - Define thresholds for critical states (e.g., low memory, high CPU usage).
   - Implement logic in `monitor.py` to:
     - Check current system metrics against defined thresholds.
     - Trigger email notifications using `smtplib` if critical states are detected.

#### 4. **Interactive Dashboard:**
   - Build a terminal-based dashboard using the `curses` library:
     - Display real-time system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) in a user-friendly format.

#### 5. **Cron Job Setup:**
   - Configure a cron job to execute `monitor.py` at desired intervals (e.g., every hour):
     - Edit cron jobs using `crontab -e` to schedule the script (`0 * * * * /path/to/python /path/to/monitor.py`).

#### 6. **Email Configuration:**
   - Store email configuration (SMTP server, credentials) securely.

#### 7. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Test the monitoring script under various conditions.
   - Deploy the scripts on the target system where monitoring is required.


### Example Code Structure:

```
 monitoring_tool/
│
├── monitoring_tool.py          # Main script for system monitoring and Interactive dashboard using curses
├                               # Email configuration (SMTP server, credentials)
├
├── README.md                   # Documentation and usage instructions
├── metrics.csv                 # CSV file for storing collected metrics
└── logs/                       # Folder for logs (optional)
```

### Additional Considerations:
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging within the scripts.
- **Security**: Ensure sensitive information (e.g., email credentials) is stored securely and not hard-coded in the scripts.
- **Customization**: Allow for easy customization of monitoring thresholds and dashboard layout.
- **Scalability**: Consider scaling the monitoring tool for monitoring multiple systems or integrating with other data storage solutions.

Plan to develop a comprehensive monitoring tool ("El Doctor") tailored to your specific needs, using Python, `psutil`, CSV data storage, email notifications, and an interactive `curses`-based dashboard for real-time monitoring of CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network metrics with alerts for critical states.
